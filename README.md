#### My recipe
This is a web app that shows recipes based on the item you searched for. 
I used *API* from **api.edamam.com** to fetch Recipe data.

*Technology used*
- HTML/CSS
- React
- React Hook

*Future plan*
- Add filters so the user can filter the result based on a parameter such as Calories, Cooking time, etc.

*What I did?*
- Created components for Recipe 
- Used React useState for state management
- Used React useEffect
- Implemented css to give the app better look

## How to run?
- Clone my repository or download it
- run `npm install` ( assuming you have React environment setup)
- run `npm start`
